				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What is recycling?</p>
<p>Recycling is a process in which waste material is turned up into usable and improved products. A lot of times we see scraps in our houses, localities and other places around us. What do we actually do with this scrap? We give this to a scrap collector who takes it at a reasonable price and sell it again after turning it into something more usable.</p>
<p>Why recycling cell phones is important?</p>
<p><span id="more-438"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>As the population is growing, we are getting out of the resources and pollution is also increasing day after day. Recycling can help us solve these problems and save us for coming disasters.</li>
<li>Recycling cell phone also becomes necessary as cell phone are made of lead, which is a toxic chemical that can result in adverse effects not only on our environment but also on our health.</li>
<li>The circuit board of phones can be made of copper, gold, zinc,lead, beryllium,tantalum and other raw materials that would require significant resources to mine and manufacture. As the natural resources are depleting at a fast rate it becomes important to recycle.</li>
<li>Recycling can help to reduce the consumption of these resources and save them for future generation. This way we can contribute to attaining sustainable development.</li>
<li>Materials used in making a phone can even pollute air, water and soil if not disposed properly. The amount of E-waste is increasing and so we all must recycle cell phones for better environment and better and healthy living in present and in future.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What all can we do to save our environment? </strong></p>
<p>We can save our environment by using our smartphones for a longer period and not changing them frequently. This may seem difficult and an outdated idea. Not changing our phones regularly may make us feel like we are living in an ancient era not an upgraded one or in an upgraded one but with an old style. However, this small step can make significant difference. It will help save our environment and of course getting a new phone after waiting gives more pleasure.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What did you do with your old mobile phone that is lying at your home? Did you hand it to the milkman? Did you just sell it for a minimum deal to your house cleaner? Did you give someone just free? There is a lot more than you can do with your old or used the mobile phone. People tend to exchange the old mobile phone more than to sell it to the re-commerce platform.</p>
<p><span id="more-430"></span></p>
<p><strong>How does exchange work?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Smartphone exchange offer starts every month.</li>
<li>Available only for selected models</li>
<li>Select the product that you want to exchange.</li>
<li>Select the brand of the product.</li>
<li>Select the exact model of the phone.</li>
<li>There is no return facility available for the exchange offer.</li>
<li>The discounted amount will appear on the screen.</li>
<li>Discounts changes day to day depending on its value.</li>
<li>Enter the IMEI number of your old phone.</li>
<li>Tap the Check option for the checking the eligibility of exchange offer of your mobile phone.</li>
<li>Enter your PIN code.</li>
<li>Agree to the terms and conditions.</li>
<li>If everything is good to you, Add it to the cart</li>
<li>Order the new mobile phone you want.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will notice that the amount of your new mobile phone is already reduced. The discount has been applied. When your new phone is delivered, the staff will check your old phone and all the details that you mentioned during the exchange. If any detail, do not match the specified condition and requirement, your exchange will be canceled.</p>
<p><strong>Comparing resale and exchange of old mobile phones</strong></p>
<p>Most of the people do not know the value of their phone. They often get carried away with the special offers that the online market offers but fail to understand the low exchange deal. The online markets that offer exchange are Flipkart, Amazon, Swappa etc. where you have a 50 % chance of exchanging your phone. These online re-commerce platforms provide you with a very low deal for the model that you want to exchange. Most of the models are not available for exchange too.</p>
<p><strong>Resale your old mobile phone, not exchange </strong></p>
<p>The best deal that you will get for your old mobile phone is provided by Instacash. This online market gives you a platform for selling your old mobile phone. It provides you with a better deal almost 30% more than the exchange amount.</p>
<ul>
<li>Authentic and Verified deal</li>
<li>Better amount than exchange</li>
<li>No barrier on the model of the smartphone</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whatever may be the cause, but the truth is that in India millions of users give you the temptation to buy a new mobile phone every year. If you do not want to cause a threat to your financial pocket, you need to sell off your old phones to finance the new purchase. The harsher part of it is not how much you are selling your old mobile phone for but how much the buyer is paying you. India is a buyer-dominated market. If you are new to this field of re-commerce, be ready to be amused. The resale market is the profitable solution for the customers<br />
<span id="more-441"></span></p>
<p><strong>The re-commerce business</strong></p>
<p>Mobile phones having features like an android system, touch screen, better camera options have greater resale demand. People believe that “QWERTY” has lost its existence now but resale market gives you an opportunity to sell it off. Android-based phones are the popular most in the smartphone industry. The re-commerce market helps you to get the best value out of any other option possible.</p>
<p><strong>Why resell a phone within two years?</strong></p>
<p>The thing that matters now is the operating system and its camera quality. The second-hand market has a huge demand for iOS and Android operating system.</p>
<ul>
<li>The launch of upgraded version decreases the value</li>
<li>The condition of the mobile phone keeps degrading</li>
<li>Market value decreases with lifespan of the mobile phone</li>
<li>The operating system version resists upgrading at a point of time.</li>
</ul>
<p>The phone values 50 percent lesser than its actual value when it is 10 days old after you have bought it. What will you do of those old phones if you do not recycle them? Selling them on re-commerce platforms like Quickr, OLX, Instacash etc gives you the best value and add money to your wallet.</p>
<p><strong>Options to sell your old mobile phone</strong></p>
<p>There are various ways that you can resell your mobile phone and some are mentioned below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Online Market: OLX, Craigslist, Instacash are such options</li>
<li>The Social Media: Posting an ad on your facebook or twitter would help connect with friends on a larger scale.</li>
<li>The local retailers make a deal with the shop nearby you or your locality.</li>
</ul>
<p>You need to be very sure with the look of the phone before you can resale it. The upgradation of every generation of a particular phone has led to the increased buying rate of a new advanced mobile phone. Why waste the money you invested in a phone long back. Sell your old phones before 2 years and get the best value possible.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>“Toote se fir na jude, jude gaanth pad jaaye” </em>is one of the best couplet of Rahim, it is not only applicable to relations but it is also applicable to some gadgets like smartphone and the solution of this is not to repair but is to resale them.</p>
<p><strong>Why repairing your own Smartphone is not a great idea</strong>?</p>
<p><span id="more-410"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Repairing your old device costs you a fortune nowadays. The original parts of the devices are priced very high due to which people tend to go for cheaper alternatives which do no good and might not function as good as the original one.</li>
<li>Instead of spending money on your old device to get it fixed, selling that device would bring you more money. Sell your old mobile phone to add investment to your new favorite mobile phone.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>But now come to an interesting alternative solution to the situation  </strong></p>
<p>Have you ever thought about how much you will <strong>benefit </strong>if a company provides you a higher amount of your product without any hectic market safari?</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A smartphone is an investment that you put in. After buying a mobile phone, you try every possible way to save it from any damage that could take place. One of the greatest fear is dropping your mobile phone on the ground or any hard surface. It is one of the most costly damage when the screen of your mobile phone breaks. Do you really want to spend to repair your phone again? It is very important to take measures to save your pocket from the extra expenditure.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-375"></span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Get a case for your mobile phone</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first thing you do after buying a mobile phone is to but a case or back cover for your mobile phone. This is the easiest way to save your phone from major physical damage. You must be worried about the look of the phone. The markets provide you different styles of covers that gives an extraordinary look to your mobile phone and suits the best to you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You might also get a waterproof and dustproof case for your mobile phone to save your phone from advanced physical damage.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Guard the mobile screen</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your mobile phone screen is the most important thing that you need to guard first. It is the most fragile part of your mobile phone. Your phone is useless if your screen does not work. There are different kinds of screen protectors that are available in the market. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most primary once is the </span><b>thin-filmed screen guard</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that protects your mobile phone screen from scratches. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The upgraded version to the primary screen guard is the </span><b>tempered glass. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">It protects your phone screen larger scratches and primary cracks. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These screen guards even protect your mobile phone screen from breaking. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Prioritize the space of your mobile phone</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We often tend to stuff all our accessories in one pocket. Avoid keeping keys, coins etc. in the same pocket as the mobile phone. It creates damage to your screen by making potential scratches and marks on it. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>No texting while walking</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About 30 percent of your physical damage to your mobile phone takes place when you text while walking. You suddenly stumble over or the phone slips from your hand and the entire screen cracks. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Keep your phone away from bathroom</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People tend to take their phone to the bathroom. You may tend to have accidents like dropping the phone in the water, sprinkling water on the phone etc. No matter how waterproof your phone is, it will need immediate action to save it from any damage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key to a greater lifespan of your mobile phone is to follow all these steps mentioned above. As quoted ‘Prevention is better than cure’. Why invest money on a smartphone unnecessary for its damage? Protect your phone before it makes a hole in your pocket. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">10 years ago, a widescreen iPod with touch control, an extensive mobile phone and a leap to an internet device was shipped. Apple did not launch three products but one. It was the one product changed the way we use mobile phones, we got an iPhone. iPhone was launched on 28 June 2007. Steve Jobs changed everything. Apple’s newly launched iPhone was 5 years advanced than another mobile phone.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-358"></span></p>
<p><b>Why is iPhone successful? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The event that marks apple being so successful is its first failure when it lost PC to Microsoft. They had to get a new direction and it was the iPods and iPhones. The key feature why Apple got at the peak is its “sensation sensibility.”</span></p>
<p><b>iPhone is driving people crazy.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple fans are crazy and excited about every new product launched and they have invaded the technological market. The innovation of iPhone has overruled smartphones. People are so crazy about iPhones that they wait hours in the queue to get the first hand over the recent launch. Even sell their kidney off to get the iPhone (Just kidding)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">iPhone is more like having a class. It is a luxury to the elite class hence distinguishing society. Interestingly, in China, people often refer iPhone as “kidney”. To get hold of the product first is more important than someone’s health. iPhone is more for the upper-class society. </span></p>
<p><b>The new generation iPhone 8</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The launch of iPhone 8 has added a mark to the entire mobile industry. iPhone 8 features:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The brand new concept of “glass design”</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The easiest charging method “wireless charging”</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An environment condition resistant: “dust and water”</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advanced retina HD display</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 3D touch facility </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A contemporary feature of 3D touch i.e. the white balance of the phone adjusts according to the environment around you.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advanced camera uniqueness with 12-megapixel camera. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recent feature of portrait mode toping it with lightning capability</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The power of “optical zooming” </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developed the fastest chip known as “A11 Bionic”</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Incorporated 3 core GPU</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Promising greater battery life</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most unknown feature “ Airpower mat” which connects every apple product wirelessly. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple has actually changed our lives. iPhone has evolved with every new product launched. iPhone has shown us the difference from the past 10 years. It has proved itself to be the revolution of mobile innovation and design. iPhones have evolved from screen resolution to the retina display, 3 inches to 7 inches and from storage to battery life. It has exceptionally proved itself repeatedly. Apple made us believe that a small device can do a lot more than we can ever think. </span></p>

<p><span id="more-340"></span></p>
<p><strong>Qualifying your iPhone for sale</strong><br />

Go to Settings &gt; General &gt; Reset and then select Erase All content and Settings and you are ready for the first step to selling iPhone.</p>
<p><strong>Selecting your online platform for selling iPhone</strong></p>
<p>Are you confused with choice of your online market place? Every online market offers a different price for your iPhone. OLX, eBay, QUICKR, SWAPPA are the different online market that will help you sell your iPhone, but might take months or days as they are open markets. But if you want to sell your phone instantly then, online re-commerce markets like Instacash help you sell your phone to the safe hands in the fraction of seconds.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Every now and then new smartphones are launched and you get tempted to sell yours and buy the latest one. After the launch of iPhone X launch, few e-commerce sites are offering massive discounts on iPhone 6, iPhone 6s, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus.</span></p>
<p>The actual price of the iPhone 6 32GB edition is Rs 25,999 right now on India-based e-commerce platform but, it is offering it for Rs.5,999.  It has also sent newsletters claiming that iPhone 6 will be available on a special discount of Rs. 3,501 which is again a lucrative offer. After the price drop, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s are now available at a price as low as Rs. 5,999 and Rs. 17,999 respectively only on their e-commerce site.<span id="more-248"></span></p>
<p>In reality there are so called &#8220;T&amp;C&#8221;s, right. All these offers can be availed with the exchange of high end smartphones like the iPhone 7 Plus, or may the Galaxy S8. It’s quite obvious that one won’t exchange their iPhone 7 for a 6 or 6s.</p>
<h3><strong>Think before falling for such offers!</strong></h3>
<p>Well, you want to sell your phone, exchange your handset to buy a new one, then do your homework and online research through and scroll all terms &amp; conditions carefully before making any selling decision.

<p>It is a very common scenario these days when we see clear sky and step out of our houses but suddenly the sky turns cloudy and it starts raining. This is the exact situation which most of us face during the monsoons. It is not only important to keep oneself dry so as to avoid getting sick but also saving our expensive smartphone from the rain. During rains, it becomes difficult to operate a touch-based device with wet fingers and also it can lead to water seepage inside the device through the edge of the glass screen and after coming in contact with the digitizer inside, the water may leave the smartphone unresponsive to touch. Also, the moment when a slight moisture is detected in your smartphone it becomes a grave problem to treat it as water damage is not considered in the warranty cover of your phone. So, we are sharing with you some of the most important tips to protect your smartphone from water damage.</p>
<p><strong>Also Read: </strong><a href="https://getinstacash.in/blog/upgrade-your-smartphone-smartly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external"><strong>Upgrade your smartphone smartly</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>If not sure, switch off immediately</strong></p>
<p>Suppose it starts raining and you do not have anything to cover your smartphone. In this case, the foremost task is to switch off your device and take out the battery if possible. It is not only risky to operate a wet phone because the device can turn off at any time and this can lead to the phone being dead and chances to recover your data become very low at that time.</p>
<p><strong>Get a raincoat for your mobile phone</strong></p>
<p>As the monsoons arrive, we keep in mind to carry an umbrella or a raincoat while traveling and try our best so that the rain does not dampen us. Similarly, while purchasing the cover for our mobile phone we must walk an extra mile and try to get a waterproof cover.</p>
<figure><img class="alignnone" src="https://tempinstacash.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/f8a85-1qoy7nb3kije0mthuqymjta.png?resize=525%2C345" alt="mobile phone covers" width="525" height="345" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>
<p>It is designed specifically in a way so as to cover all the dimensions through which our smartphone/mobile phone can get affected. Though a waterproof cover is not that attractive to look at, but it protects the smartphone from the direct effect of the rain and serves as a raincoat providing a sheath from the rains.</p>
<p><strong>Polybag and Papers</strong></p>
<p>At times when you don’t have a waterproof cover for your smartphone and it rains heavily then in that case to protect your valuable mobile phone, simply cover your phone in a transparent plastic, wrap it properly and cover the ends using a tape. This will prevent water seepage into your smartphone.</p>
<p><strong>Ziplock phone with silica gels</strong></p>
<p>Silica gel is very useful in keeping things dry. So next time when you see any silica sachets lying inside a packet or a new water bottle, please don’t throw it away. Rather you can put it to use in a very effective manner. If you purchase a ziplock or a similar pouch then you can put that silica sachet inside it and keep it in your wallet. Buying a ziplock or a pouch is really cost effective and is easily available in the market.</p>

<p>When it starts to rain, you can put your phone in that ziplock with the silica gel. This not only prevents water from getting inside the device but the silica gel absorbs the excess moisture if present.</p>
<p><strong>Sync your accounts</strong></p>
<p>Being cautious is always helpful in the long run. You can try to have a backup for all your valuable data on your phone. You can very well in advance get a backup of your pictures and contacts either using your Google and iCloud ids or you can use the cloud services like Dropbox to save your important files.</p>
<p>Above mentioned ways would really help you to safeguard your smartphone and protect it from a downpour. Enjoy the rainy season and keep your smartphone safe. Happy Monsoon!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The launch of smartphones in the market has brought a revolutionizing change in the lives of people where we have transformed the way technology has impacted us for the betterment of people. We have a device in our pockets that not only swayed the handheld device market but also brought a great change in the world of photography. Nowadays, people have developed a great liking for high-resolution clear pictures which they can post on Facebook, Instagram, etc and the selfie craze is ever increasing.</p>
<p><span id="more-121"></span></p>
<blockquote><p><em>“Update: </em><a href="https://goo.gl/yN12nj" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external"><em>ZeroWaste is now InstaCash</em></a><em>”</em></p></blockquote>
<figure class="wp-caption">
<p><figure style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img src="https://tempinstacash.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/c9bfd-1ijmm1fg19wpopswci3fvta.png?resize=525%2C345" alt="PM_taking_selfie_with_his_smartphone" width="525" height="345" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Indian PM Narendra Modi taking selfie with the youth</figcaption></figure><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 1rem;">Photography has become a big reason for the success of smartphones and smartphone photography has gained so much popularity these days that it has almost killed the compact camera market. There are many important milestones in the way how smartphone photography has developed through the years, so let us have a quick glimpse of the interesting phenomenon behind the story.</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Initial phase</strong></p>
<p>We must have a look towards the initial cameras in the earlier smartphones and how did a transition occur from that initial phase. There were two smartphones that arrived with the camera onboard. One was the initial iPhone which had a two-megapixel rear camera which was unable to record video and the other was HTC Dream (T-Mobile G1) with a 3.15-megapixel sensor that touted autofocus capabilities but again no video shooting options. Photography expectations were much lower those days as compared to today’s smartphones which have advanced features like low light performance, optical image stabilization, and 4k video recording.</p>
<p><strong>The outburst of selfie shooter</strong></p>
<p>In 2003, Sony Ericsson’s Z1010 was the first phone with a front facing camera but the selfie phones reached the smartphone market in 2010 when handsets like iPhone 4 and HTC Evo 4G were launched. Originally, these tiny sensors had no extra features and the front-facing camera was considerably poorer than the rear camera on a phone. In early days, the front-facing cameras were popular for video calling rather than taking stylish selfies. But these days, we have a completely different scenario, people are crazy after selfies. We have smartphones that boast about the capabilities of their front-facing camera like flagships from Samsung, HTC and others that offer 8 to 16 megapixels in their front-facing cameras with aperture and lens configurations that match up their rear camera setups, producing much better results. Also, the beautification of pictures has really seen a tremendous change on the software side going in hand with the ever-increasing selfie trend.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption">
<p><figure style="width: 730px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img src="https://tempinstacash.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/2689b-15it7-nxpbcyjgrt7ly8afa.png?resize=525%2C302" alt="Oppo_smartphone" width="525" height="302" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Oppo F3</figcaption></figure><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption>The new Oppo F3 is the first phone to feature the advanced technology of dual front-facing camera with one 16 megapixel and the other 8 megapixels, with wider shooting options to produce better-looking selfies. Oppo also picked up this trend earlier with the launching of its N1 phone with a swiveling camera setup to deliver equal quality selfie and regular shots.</figure>

<p><strong>Resolution Race</strong></p>
<p>Although the resolution is not everything in a smartphone camera but the higher numbers always attract the customer’s eye. Apple’s iPhones are considered the best shooters and they marked a gradual change from 5 to 8 then to 12 megapixels and in a similar manner, between the launch of Galaxy S2 in 2011 and Galaxy S4 in 2013, Samsung moved from 8 to 13 megapixels and in 2014 it had Galaxy S5 with 16 megapixels. Sony and Nokia Lumia were also ahead in the race. In 2013, Sony launched Xperia Z1 with 21 megapixels camera but it was overshadowed by the Lumia 1020’s 41-megapixel camera in the same year which was much acknowledged by people.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption">
<p><figure style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img src="https://tempinstacash.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/9e7f4-1e6oraf4vfcxigy4mjl9ppg.png?resize=525%2C345" alt="Nokia_lumia_smartphone_camera" width="525" height="345" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Nokia lumia 1020 with 41 MP rear camera</figcaption></figure><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 1rem;">The smartphones in general quickly averaged the rear camera resolution at around 13 megapixels after just 3 generations. Not only resolution but advanced features like optical image stabilization also bloomed in 2014.</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Dual Cameras and the Future</strong></p>
<p>Nowadays, as Smartphone companies are continuously improvising camera quality, some companies have drifted from this normal trend and differentiated themselves with Dual Cameras with more cost conserving sensors.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption">
<p><figure style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img src="https://tempinstacash.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/439fd-1jpxfuh_srwpaiblh-lsdma.png?resize=525%2C345" alt="Applr_iPhone_smartphone" width="525" height="345" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Apple iPhone 7 Plus</figcaption></figure><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 1rem;">Previously also some companies have tried this like HTC One M8 in 2014, LG Optimus 3D in 2011. It can be clearly foreseen that the efficient image processing and an increase in the mobile memory bandwidth will lower down the demands for cream layer Smartphone companies, supporting the changed hardware configurations with multiple cameras and allow more robust image processing.</span></figcaption></figure>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the advent of newer technology, the size of operating systems in smartphones is getting larger. Also, there is an increase in the storage space requirement for storing the apps and photos nowadays as we are getting much more useful apps for our smartphones but with larger sizes. Even the Facebook app alone takes up 250 MB. Then the videos, games, images and automatic background backups and processes eat up a lot of space through your phone memory.</p>
<p><span id="more-120"></span></p>
<blockquote><p><em>“Update: </em><a href="https://goo.gl/yN12nj" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external"><em>ZeroWaste is now InstaCash</em></a><em>”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>We have limited storage for apps in our smartphones and it frequently shows you insufficient space error and then there is no fix. Sometimes this really causes a trouble when at some specific situation, you are in need of a particular application to be installed on your phone but you suddenly get a message indicating the running out storage space on your phone. For dealing with these kind of troublesome issues, we have devised out some solutions which you can try for optimizing the use of storage space available on your device.</p>
<p><strong>• Uninstall unwanted apps</strong></p>
<p>This is the foremost thing to be done when your phone notifies you for insufficient storage space. There are many apps installed on your phone which are no longer in your use. Such types of unwanted apps keep on eating up the valuable storage area which can be used to store something important. So you should regularly keep on deleting those apps which are no longer of use.
