<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go to the Settings -&gt; Accounts -&gt; Google -&gt;Sync in your new phone. All your contacts will be shown on the phone after sync is done.</span></p>

<h2><b>What is something extraordinary in 5G smartphones?</b></h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Previously it was found that 5G smartphone will have to offer at least 20 GBPS download and 10GBPS upload speed. Actually, it states that users will see a minimum 100Mbps download speed and 50Mbps upload speed. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">5G base station will have to cover users traveling up to 500 Km/h so your data connection will not be lost in the train. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://getinstacash.in/blog/5g-impacts/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="follow external noopener noreferrer">5G should offer a maximum latency</a> of 4ms. When it compares to 4G LTE connection, it offers around 82ms latency. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">5G also enable connectivity with the low internet of things and supports device to device connectivity for low latency connections. </span></li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Top Five Companies to launch 5G Smartphones in 2019</strong></h2>
<h3><strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;">1.  Samsung</span></strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In August, Samsung said that it is working with South Korean telecommunication companies to release its first 5G phone. Rumors indicate that the device may be galaxy S10 plus. <a href="https://getinstacash.in/blog/samsung-galaxy-s9-and-s9-plus-features-specs-release-date/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="follow external noopener noreferrer">Samsung</a> may release three variants Galaxy S10, Galaxy S10 plus and Galaxy S10 5G option only in S10 plus. The phone will require 3 to 4 more antennas and cost more than the 4G version so Samsung may keep the low cost of other S10 variants by making the 5G, the most premium phone.  </span></p>
<h3><strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;">2. Huawei</span></strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Huawei has confirmed that it will release its first 5G smartphone before the end of June 2019. They have also confirmed that the phone will have a foldable screen too. The 5G will be faster, and more responsive than anything before. In some cases, there would be an application in a self-driving car, telemedicine called the internet of things. 5G phones internet speed will be 10 times more than the 4G. Huawei is making it a little bit different by making its own processor and modem rather than using the Qualcomm processor. </span></p>
<h3><strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;">3. OnePlus</span></strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OnePlus has already confirmed that they will be the first company to launch 5G phones in 2019. They are closely working with the Qualcomm team in terms of tech and R&amp;D process. It is expected that the company will launch two phones in 2019 which has not done yet. OnePlus 5G phone may be a little expensive due to its connectivity with 5G. Though OnePlus has increased its phone prices steadily as more features also added to the phone still Oneplus is the affordable flagship phone as compared to other phones. </span></p>
<h3><strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;">4. Google</span></strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google has not revealed its plan for a 5G phone but Verizon company states that it’s planning to roll out a 5G phone in 2019 similar to other carries. Google has been exclusively working with Verizon for <a href="https://getinstacash.in/blog/welcome-google-pixel/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="follow external noopener noreferrer">pixel phones</a>, maybe that means Google will come up with google pixel 4, a 5G phone. If it follows the tradition then the phone will come in October. </span></p>
<h3><strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;">5. Lenovo/Motorola</span></strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Motorola &amp; Verizon came up in Chicago and announced Moto Z3 5G phone. It will deliver 10 times faster speed than the 4G LTE. But it is also true that MotoZ3 is not a 5G phone on its own. It contains the right technology to access 4G data speeds. Moto Z3 will get a 5G speed with moto 5G moto mod. Basically, Moto Z3 is a  4G phone with magnetic pins that can be connected with a variety of Mods. </span></p>

<p>We have included the best 6GB RAM phones like <a href="https://getinstacash.in/blog/one-plus-6-vs-samsung-galaxy-s9/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="follow external noopener noreferrer">OnePlus 6</a>, Redmi Note 5 Pro, Samsung S9 Plus. All these smartphones are great for multitasking.</p>
<h2><strong>Let’s have a look at the Best 6GB RAM Phones</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>1. Redmi Note 5 Pro (Starts From Rs 14,999) </strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Buy for Front Camera</li>
<li>Runs on Qualcomm Snapdragon 636</li>
<li>64GB Internal Storage and expandable up to 126GB</li>
<li>5.99-inch touchscreen display with a resolution of 1080 x 2160 pixels</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the first phone with Snapdragon 636 from<a href="https://getinstacash.in/blog/xiaomi-best-selling-smartphone-in-india/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="follow external noopener noreferrer"> Xiaomi series</a> with a new GPU that promise to deliver better gaming performance. Additionally, It is the first affordable Redmi series to feature on 18:9 display. It looks same as Redmi Note 5 from the front and but at the back, there is a set up of the dual camera.

<p>OnePlus has confirmed October 30 as the launch date for India Launch event and terms it as <strong>&#8220;Unlock the Speed&#8221;</strong>. It will be surprising to see what OnePlus has more to offer to Indian fans.</p>
<p><strong>1. OnePlus 6T Drops Headphone Jack</strong></p>
<p>The brands are now following the trend of dropping headphone jack in their new version of the flagship phones. OnePlus believes that headphone jack is not a need anymore as their users tend to use wireless headphones to listen to music. Technically, the brand plans to utilize this space for an in-display fingerprint sensor. In terms of tracing back to the history, Apple was the first brand to drop off the headphone jack.</p>
<blockquote><p>Here are the list of exciting <a href="https://getinstacash.in/blog/new-smartphone-technology/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="follow external noopener noreferrer">upcoming technologies and trends</a>! Read more&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<h3><strong>2. Screen Unlock is the New Revolution</strong></h3>
<p>The <span style="font-weight: 400;">In-display fingerprint sensors are a new trend in the smartphone industry. It is embedded on the display rather than placing it physically on the back or front of the device. Initially, OnePlus was quite skeptical in terms of implementing this feature on their devices but it has now finally taken a call.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company dubs this technology as “Screen Unlock” and claims the technology to be fully secured through Snapdragon Trustzone.</span></p>
<h3><strong>3. Waterdrop Notch Offers Enhanced Display Experience</strong></h3>
<p>The iPhone X was the first device to introduce waterdrop notch in their displays. It can be seen that OnePlus is also going with the trend to give enhanced display experience to their users. The notch usually gives more space to the display while opposing the conventional setup. This looks quite alluring and adds to style statement of smartphone users. It&#8217;s now becoming a favorite trend among the smartphone consumers.</p>
<p>Best Picks for you to buy <a href="https://getinstacash.in/blog/androidgo-budget-phones-with-better-performance/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="follow external noopener noreferrer">budget smartphones with best features</a>!</p>
<h3><strong>4. OnePlus Drops Wireless Charging</strong></h3>
<p>The OnePlus believes that the wireless charging is not at all an efficient technology to be used for the flagship devices.  It holds the view that the technology is still in its development phase and not feasible. The OnePlus promised that the company will be utilizing this technology in the future. The OnePlus 6T will come with Dash Charger to deliver fast charging experience.</p>
<h3><strong>5. OnePlus 6T is water resistant</strong></h3>
<p>OnePlus 6T is water resistant, it can survive rain splashes and can even work if you accidentally drop it on the water sink.  It is quite surprising that OnePlus doesn&#8217;t come with an official IP rating. The brand believes that it&#8217;s not worth for OnePlus to add an extra price tag.</p>
<h3><strong>6. Price Competitiveness</strong></h3>
<p>There are lots of brands launching <a href="https://getinstacash.in/blog/xiaomi-mi-a2-vs-honor-play/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="follow external noopener noreferrer">smartphones with competing features</a>. OnePlus holds the reputation of affordable flagship brand that is competing tough with Apple &amp; Samsung.  The brand has assured its consumers and fans that new flagship will be priced quite lower than that of its competitors. This move could give an edge to the OnePlus as a competing brand.</p>

<h2><b>Why should you pick up Honor play?</b></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kirin 970 Processor</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perfect-fit for game player</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazing battery backup</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Honor play is specially designed to complete with every other <a href="https://getinstacash.in/blog/best-phones-to-buy-under-10k-15k/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="follow external noopener noreferrer">budget phone</a> when it comes to performance. Kirin 970 is close enough to snapdragon 845 in the synthetic score. Although snapdragon 660 in Xiaomi Mi A2 is quite capable but not as fast as Kirin 970. Gaming is the delight of this phone. Are you also addicted to PUBG game? Then surely, playing on this phone is an amazing fun. It enhances the gaming experience of the user.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The battery of 3700mAH of this phone makes it more impressive. It delivers fast charging and delivers up to 50% charging in 30 minutes. </span></p>
<h2><b>Which Phone Should You Buy? Honor Play it is</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is evident that Mi A2 scores double when it comes to Android One and camera but lacks in 3.5mm jack and microSD slot. Honor play is lead in the performance with its Kirin 970 and if you are a game lover then this will work best for you. This phone performance matches with <a href="https://getinstacash.in/blog/one-plus-6-vs-samsung-galaxy-s9/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="follow external noopener noreferrer">OnePlus 6</a> in half of the price. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, it is your choice. If you’re more likely to be game lover then Honor Play is your choice and if you want a clean user interface and frequent updates then Mi A2 is the right choice for you.</span></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget to sell old phone if you plan to purchase a new phone. Now the question is <a href="https://getinstacash.in/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="follow external noopener noreferrer">where can i sell my phone for a good price</a>? InstaCash is the platform where you can sell phone at best price.</p>

<h2><strong>I have penned down a list of best antiviruses for android that work best on android.</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>1. AhnLab V3 mobile Security</strong></h3>
<p>AhnLab showed a dramatic detection of 99.9% real time detection of new malware&#8217;s and a 100% rate of detecting known malware&#8217;s, putting him among the top contenders of the security division. Though this app lacks a few basic features like parental control and message filter that other top apps provide, it is still a viable best antivirus for android against threats to keep your device ready for all incoming malware.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Avast Mobile Security</strong></h3>
<p>Avast Mobile Security has been there for a while and Avast has made a really good name in the industry. With an active detection rate of 99.9% and no burden on your mobile’s battery, Avast is a legitimate choice for all your security needs. During a normal day of use, Avast won’t drain your battery much and it also doesn’t <a href="https://getinstacash.in/blog/common-mobile-phone-problems-and-solutions/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="follow external noopener noreferrer">slow your phone</a> by running unnecessary background operations. Safe Browsing feature helps you to browse safely over the internet and saves you against phishing attacks from malicious websites. Anti-theft features gives you a remote wipe option to protect your phone against theft of content. Avast is a must try.</p>
<h3><strong>3. AVG Antivirus</strong></h3>
<p>This antivirus for android showed an astounding 100% detection against both real-time and previously detected malware. AVG also come with a few handy features like call blocking, app locker and anti-theft.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Bitdefender Mobile Security</strong></h3>
<p>Bitdefender is a name that has unparalleled reputation and does the same in its mobile security division. A 99% malware detection rate in real-time and 100% malware clearance for threats discovered in the last 4 weeks, puts Bitdefender a solid competition against all available antivirus applications. As far as usability goes, Bitdefender does a nice job by using minimum battery and RAM. Also it raised zero false alarms against apps downloaded from play store and other legitimate platforms.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Recommended read: <a href="https://getinstacash.in/blog/shocking-facts-about-mobile-phones/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="follow external noopener noreferrer">Do you know these shocking facts about mobile phone?</a></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Bitdefender also packs in great features that some of the competition fail to offer like anti-theft, remote lock, phone wipe, locate your phone, safe browsing and phishing protection which makes it best antivirus for android. Although call blocking and message filtering are not as efficient as some other competition provide. A privacy advisor and app lock also comes in as a handy feature. Overall it&#8217;s a great YES YES.</p>
<h3><strong>5. Kaspersky Lab Security</strong></h3>
<p>Kaspersky showed a remarkable 99.6% real time detection of new malware&#8217;s and 100% detection rate of known malware&#8217;s. Impressed with the usability of this app as it uses the least RAM and battery. All <a href="https://getinstacash.in/blog/mobile-features-which-can-make-your-life-easy/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="follow external noopener noreferrer">additional features of mobile</a> like the remote locking, phone wipe, call blocking, message filtering, safe browsing, anti-phishing protection, privacy protection are available making this a preferable antivirus for android choice. Also Kaspersky has built a good reputation over the years giving it an edge over other app publishers.</p>
<h3><strong>6.  Norton Mobile Security</strong></h3>
<p>THIS ONE IS A MASTERPIECE or best antivirus for android in another term. 100% detection rate of real time known viruses and malware, Norton works the finest with regular updates. It raised zero false alarms and is feature packed with safe browsing, data backup, anti-theft and call blocking in its rich arsenal.</p>
<h3><strong>7. PSafe DFNDR</strong></h3>
<p>This one did a flawless job of 100% detection rate of both real-time and recently known threats. Psafe also earns an extra mark for keeping light on battery and performance. The device runs without a jerk and raised zero false alarms for apps downloaded from trusted sources. Some other additional features like call blocking, remote wipe, remote lock and locate your device will come in handy for new and old users both.</p>
<p>According to a report from AV-TEST, 2019 will mark the biggest increase in android malware and this is a significant warning to tell us that it&#8217;s time to get our laces tied up and be prepared for all incoming threats. Having an best antivirus for android device is a must today and should not be ignored. Pick from our list of available packages and keep your device safe from malware and threats.

<p>Can you fix the &#8220;insufficient storage available&#8221; error message on your phone? Yes, there are few ways to get more storage on your phone.<span id="more-655"></span></p>
<h2><strong>Easy ways to increase phone storage</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>1. Add external storage</strong></h3>
<p>The 1st option that comes to mind. Although with the boom of dual sim phones in the market, most phones won’t allow you to do so unless you are willing to sacrifice the secondary sim slot for some external space. Make sure that you temper your phone to <a href="https://getinstacash.in/blog/apps-to-maximize-android-performance/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="follow external noopener noreferrer">install apps</a> and camera to use the external storage as its primary device.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Delete cache memory</strong></h3>
<p>As the time goes, every phone fills up with the cache files. Clearing cache will not delete any important file from your phone. You can also clear the cache of the individual app if required.</p>
<p>Go to the Settings -&gt; Storage, users will see the storage details such as used space, Cache data.</p>
<p>Tap on the cache data and click on “OK” to clear cache data.</p>
<p>This is surely going to help you to get more storage and remove unwanted storage from your phone.</p>

<h3><strong>3. Clean duplicate photos</strong></h3>
<p>Make sure that you have the rest backed up in online storage&#8217;s like the google drive and google photos. Dropbox is another such excellent space where you can sync your photos and other useful files.</p>

<h3><strong>4. Use Cloud for Storage</strong></h3>
<p>Both Google and Apple have their own cloud server where you can store your files.</p>
<p><strong>Google Drive</strong><br />
It provides 15 GB of storage.<br />
Only need a gmail account to access google drive.<br />
Save all your photos in google photo or automatically backup all your photos in google photos</p>
<p><strong>Apple’s iCloud Drive</strong><br />
It provides 5 GB of storage.<br />
Go to Settings –&gt; iCloud –&gt; Photos, Turn on the option and optimize the storage.<br />
Your phone will automatically store your photos at minimum resolution but they will backup at cloud at high resolution.</p>

<h3><strong>5. Remove Bloatware from your phone</strong></h3>
<p>You are aware of this that you can’t delete the inbuilt apps for your phone which you are not using even, it is only occupying the storage of your phone. These are the example of “Bloatware apps”. Some may be useful for you but most of the apps are useless. Rooting your device is the option to remove bloatware from your phone and get more storage on your phone. This might void your warranty though, so wait for your warranty to go out</p>
<h3><strong>6. Move to Stock Android</strong></h3>
<p>Most phones from <a href="https://getinstacash.in/blog/samsung-galaxy-s9-and-s9-plus-features-specs-release-date/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="follow external noopener noreferrer">Samsung</a>, Xiaomi, LG, Vivo, Oppo etc use a skin on top to give you a personalized experience. This needs more storage than stock android. Try moving to stock android. This might void your warranty though. So wait for your warranty to go out and then move to stock android.</p>
<h3><strong>7. Other useful ways to get more storage</strong></h3>
<p>Clear your downloads and always look for partially downloaded files that take up the storage but never show up in the gallery or the video players.</p>
<p>OTG (OnTheGo) pen drives available now. You can always carry one to keep files handy and safe.</p>
<p>Use online music players like Gaana and Saavn to look out for your favorite songs. Instead of keeping junks of music files.</p>
<p>Use video/photo compressors to free up the additional space.</p>
<p>Although deleting images, remove unnecessary apps can free up the storage on your phone. After trying all the above-mentioned steps, if your phone still popup with &#8220;insufficient storage&#8221; then it&#8217;s time to upgrade your phone with more storage and <a href="https://getinstacash.in/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="follow external noopener noreferrer">sell your old phone at good price</a> at instacash.</p>
