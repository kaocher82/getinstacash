<h2><b>What is something extraordinary in 5G smartphones?</b></h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Previously it was found that 5G smartphone will have to offer at least 20 GBPS download and 10GBPS upload speed. Actually, it states that users will see a minimum 100Mbps download speed and 50Mbps upload speed. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">5G base station will have to cover users traveling up to 500 Km/h so your data connection will not be lost in the train. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://getinstacash.in/blog/5g-impacts/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="follow external noopener noreferrer">5G should offer a maximum latency</a> of 4ms. When it compares to 4G LTE connection, it offers around 82ms latency. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">5G also enable connectivity with the low internet of things and supports device to device connectivity for low latency connections. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b>5G vs </b><b>LTE Advanced</b></h2>

<h2><strong>Top Five Companies to launch 5G Smartphones in 2019</strong></h2>
<h3><strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;">1.Â  Samsung</span></strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In August, Samsung said that it is working with South Korean telecommunication companies to release its first 5G phone. Rumors indicate that the device may be galaxy S10 plus. <a href="https://getinstacash.in/blog/samsung-galaxy-s9-and-s9-plus-features-specs-release-date/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="follow external noopener noreferrer">Samsung</a> may release three variants Galaxy S10, Galaxy S10 plus and Galaxy S10 5G option only in S10 plus. The phone will require 3 to 4 more antennas and cost more than the 4G version so Samsung may keep the low cost of other S10 variants by making the 5G, the most premium phone. Â </span></p>
<h3><strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;">2. Huawei</span></strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Huawei has confirmed that it will release its first 5G smartphone before the end of June 2019. They have also confirmed that the phone will have a foldable screen too. The 5G will be faster, and more responsive than anything before. In some cases, there would be an application in a self-driving car, telemedicine called the internet of things. 5G phones internet speed will be 10 times more than the 4G. Huawei is making it a little bit different by making its own processor and modem rather than using the Qualcomm processor. </span></p>
<h3><strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;">3. OnePlus</span></strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OnePlus has already confirmed that they will be the first company to launch 5G phones in 2019. They are closely working with the Qualcomm team in terms of tech and R&amp;D process. It is expected that the company will launch two phones in 2019 which has not done yet. OnePlus 5G phone may be a little expensive due to its connectivity with 5G. Though OnePlus has increased its phone prices steadily as more features also added to the phone still Oneplus is the affordable flagship phone as compared to other phones. </span></p>
<h3><strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;">4. Google</span></strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google has not revealed its plan for a 5G phone but Verizon company states that itâs planning to roll out a 5G phone in 2019 similar to other carries. Google has been exclusively working with Verizon for <a href="https://getinstacash.in/blog/welcome-google-pixel/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="follow external noopener noreferrer">pixel phones</a>, maybe that means Google will come up with google pixel 4, a 5G phone. If it follows the tradition then the phone will come in October. </span></p>
<h3><strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;">5. Lenovo/Motorola</span></strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Motorola &amp; Verizon came up in Chicago and announced Moto Z3 5G phone. It will deliver 10 times faster speed than the 4G LTE. But it is also true that MotoZ3 is not a 5G phone on its own. It contains the right technology to access 4G data speeds. Moto Z3 will get a 5G speed with moto 5G moto mod. Basically, Moto Z3 is a Â 4G phone with magnetic pins that can be connected with a variety of Mods. </span></p>

Here are some of the best </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">smartphone photography</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tips to help you capture the best of the festival. </span></p>
<h3><b>Pre-Requisites: </b></h3>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of the devices come with a pro camera option. If you donât have pro feature in built-in camera then you can download Camera+ or Camera FV5 app from google play store. These are the best apps for taking pictures. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enable Grid Option in Phone Camera to get the perfect angle. You can easily switch on the grid option in camera settings. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can get Accessories like- Tripod or Smartphone Mount to get better pictures.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get familiar with keywords like- ISO and Shutter speed. The ISO decides the amount of light while shutter speed controls the light getting exposed to the camera sensor.</span></li>
</ul>

Apple also claims that the iOS 12 will <a href="https://getinstacash.in/blog/ways-to-speed-up-android-phone-performance/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="follow external noopener noreferrer">optimize the performance</a> for older versions of supported iPhones and iPads as well. This could be a great move to give new life to old apple devices and will be a definite move to retain the good market value.</span></p>
<h3><b style="font-size: 1rem;">Simplified Grouped Notifications</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The grouped notifications could be a useful feature that will help you to sort notifications on lock screen easily. This could really enhance the way to improve the readability of the delivered notifications. This feature is already available in android devices and comes quite later in Apple devices to give more power to users to control notifications.</span></p>

<h3><b style="font-size: 1rem;">Do Not Disturb to let you sleep peacefully</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bedtime feature is added in do not disturb mode to let you sleep peacefully. This feature allows notifications and messages to deliver silently without waking up the phone screen. If you enable the bedtime mode, the phone screen gets dimmed and notifications are sent directly to notifications history. </span></p>
<h3><b style="font-size: 1rem;">Supports Multiple Face IDs for Phone Lock</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The iOS 12 allows users to have multiple Face ID integration to allow phone lock. Previously, this feature was only limited to the single face id which created a trouble in case you want someone else to have access to your phone. This could be a great feature for couples to have access to each others phone through Face ID.</span></p>
<h3><b style="font-size: 1rem;">The improved version of Photos App</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The photos app in iOS 12 is quite smart as it supports improved search capabilities to let you search your favorite photos and moments easily. This will allow you to search the photos based on the events, places, people and dates. It also prompts suggestion to share your photos with a curated list of people who might be in your pictures. </span></p>
<h3><b style="font-size: 1rem;">Screen time lets you control your phone excessive usage</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The screen time feature is quite helpful in getting away from the smartphone addiction as it helps you to limit your phone usage. Screen time features analyses your phone usage behaviors and offers data and statistics on how you are using your smartphone. This also helps in limiting app features based on the statistics. One surprising feature it offers is that it lets you control and access the screen time of your friends and family members. </span></p>

<p>I am kind of glad that there was no social media fever when I was a teenager. The teenage is when you learn something new, try different things and this is what you are doing with your teenager. Surfing the internet for whole day, <a href="https://getinstacash.in/blog/best-selfie-phone-for-photo-addicts/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="follow external noopener noreferrer">clicking risky selfies</a>, posting them on Facebook &amp; Instagram, doing some dangerous task to gain popularity on social media. Letâs have a look at the risky and high dangerous challenges people are doing and posting on the social media.</p>
<h2><strong>Latest Social Media Challenges</strong></h2>
<p>Letâs talk about the latest and trendy social media KiKi challenge where a person has to jump from the moving car and dance alongside it on the song âIn My Feelingsâ. Mumbai police &amp; Jaipur police warned people to against the Kiki challenge but people are not ready to stop Just for being trendy on social media. Have you also tried this kiki challenge or planning to do this challenge? If yes, then you are also a part of the artificial world.</p>
<p>The next weird challenge is Momo challenge, A new blue whale challenge where participants are told to contact Momo which is an âunknown numberâ. Users are threatened to harm or kill themselves. A few weeks ago, a 12-year-old girl in Buenos Aires, Argentina hanged herself from a tree for completing Momo challenge.</p>
<p>The Kylie Jenner Lip Challenge where girls enlarge their lips using a shot glass for an oversized pouty look. The hot pepper challenge where people eat chili peppers to rank highest on then the Scoville Hotness scale. The choking game where two people intentionally cut off each other oxygen.</p>
<h2><strong>Why people prefer being on social media?</strong></h2>
<p>These challenges are too dangerous but still, young teenagers are part of these challenges. The question arises what is the need of these dangerous challenges. According to Dr. Karthik KN, these days youngsters suffer from personality disorders. This is the serious issue which needs to solve as soon as possible. Now the next question arises that What is the right way of cure from FOMO?</p>
<p>The best antidote for FOMO is consciously choosing a life of simple living, essentials or minimalism. I agree that technology is great but only when if its is <a href="https://getinstacash.in/blog/businesses-smartphone/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="follow external noopener noreferrer">getting used in a right way</a> and right time. What you are watching on social media is not necessary nor real. Lastly but impactful, donât think that what people will think.</p>
<p>New Samsung Galaxy Note 9 is out in the market. Craving for the new phone? <a href="https://getinstacash.in/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="follow external noopener noreferrer">Sell mobile online</a> to buy a new phone in your budget.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this digital world, your personal information is no more safe. To avoid access of third-party apps scanning your Gmail, Google recommended to visit their âSecurity Checkup Pageâ to review the permissions youâve given to non-google apps.</span></p>
<h2><strong>How to Stop Third-Party Apps from Scanning Your Gmail</strong></h2>
<p>Visit the Google security page: <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/security-checkup/3" data-wpel-link="external" rel="follow external noopener noreferrer">https://myaccount.google.com/security-checkup/3</a></p>

<h2><strong>How google review process works for third-party apps?</strong></h2>
<p>Before accessing your Gmail inbox, these third-party apps go for the review process to make sure that they will not access any other information rather than what they claim for. Furthermore, In order to pass the review process, the non-google app should pass this key requirement.</p>
<p>App should be clear how they are using your data and guarantee the privacy of the information they are using. The privacy policy must be prominent and clear.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget to <a href="https://getinstacash.in/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="follow external noopener noreferrer">sell your cell phone</a> if you buy a new phone.</p>
